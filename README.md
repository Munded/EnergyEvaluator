# EnergyEvaluator

There are some issues and things I would have liked to do better which I've highlighted in code comments

NOTE: the emission values in the results seem to be different than the supplied documentation, althought it's working correctly
I am hoping this is due to an issue with the data in the supplied file as there seems to be some eroneous fields such as energy being 0 for some generators.
If this is not the case, I would be very interested to find out where I screwed up
